"My personal documentation could be useful for others who also enjoy using "unconventional" setups. Initially, I began creating documentation solely for my own reference, to replicate my setups in case of failures or damages. However, since this process occasionally involved the assistance of others, I decided to 'give something back' by sharing my experiences and lessons learned, allowing others to benefit from my mistakes."
